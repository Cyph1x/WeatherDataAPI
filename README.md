# WeatherDataAPI
### School Assignment
 
For this assignment we needed to create a MongoDB REST API to interact with a large dataset of raw climate data.

The API will be used by a educational instatution's students to analyse climate data. <sub>The Data is from IOT devices in Queensland</sub>

Authentication and Authorisation are performed via ApiKeys with resource based permissions.
